# Meson native file for vcpkg integration
# This file enables automatic vcpkg dependency management for aubio
#
# Usage in CI/CD:
#   meson setup builddir --native-file=meson-vcpkg.txt
#
# For local development, you can override vcpkg_root:
#   meson setup builddir --native-file=meson-vcpkg.txt -Dvcpkg_root=/path/to/vcpkg

[constants]
# vcpkg_root will be set by environment variable VCPKG_ROOT or default to vcpkg_installed
vcpkg_root_env = '${VCPKG_ROOT}'

# Determine platform triplet
host_system = host_machine.system()
host_arch = host_machine.cpu_family()

[built-in options]
# These will be set by the meson.build based on detected vcpkg installation
# pkg_config_path and cmake_prefix_path are configured in meson.build

[properties]
# vcpkg is used as a subproject, installed via manifest mode
